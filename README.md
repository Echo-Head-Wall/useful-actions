# 🎯 CODEOWNER Reviewers Action

Hey there! 👋 I made this GitHub Action because it was diffcult for people to find the right reviewers for PRs which was driving me insane. It automagically figures out who should review your PR based on your CODEOWNERS file and drops a customizible comment for you to add instructions on how to contact the reviewers! ✨

## ✨ What This Does

- 🔍 Finds the right reviewers based on which files you changed (no more guessing!)
- 🔒 Keeps track of security reviewers separately (because safety first!)
- 💬 Lets you add custom messages (for when you need that personal touch)
- 📝 Works with CODEOWNERS files wherever you put them
- 🎯 Smart enough to pick the most specific rules first (no more pattern confusion!)

## 🚀 How to Use It

Drop this into a new file (like `.github/workflows/codeowner-reviewers.yml`):

```yaml
name: Get Those Reviewers!

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  add-reviewers:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Do The Thing
        uses: Echo-Head-Wall/useful-actions/codeowner-reviewers-action@3eb9868b6456ef475d198911687c1c72a138b59c
        with:
          # Add a friendly message if you want!
          custom_message: "Hi friends! Would love your eyes on this when you have a sec"
          
          # Using a different CODEOWNERS file? No problem!
          codeowners_path: '.github/CODEOWNERS'
          
          # Got specific security folks? List them here!
          security_reviewers: '@security-friend,@security-buddy'
```

## 🎨 The Options

### Stuff You Can Customize

| `codeowners_path` | Where's your CODEOWNERS file hiding? | Nope! | `.github/CODEOWNERS` |
| `security_reviewers` | Your security pals | Nope! | empty |

### What You Get Back
| Output | What's That? |
|--------|--------------|
| `reviewers` | A list of everyone it found (separated by commas) |

## 📝 CODEOWNERS Example

Here's what your CODEOWNERS file might look like:

```plaintext
# The cool people who watch over everything
*       @team-awesome @code-wizard

# The docs squad
/docs/  @docs-friends

# The code crew
/src/   @dev-buddies

# Security stuff needs extra 👀
/security/   @security-squad
/auth/       @security-squad @auth-team
```

## 💬 What The Comment Looks Like

The action drops a comment that's something like this:

```markdown
## 👥 Required Reviewers

### Reviewers for this PR:
- @dev-buddies
- @docs-friends

> 💡 These lovely people were picked based on what you changed!

## 🔒 Security Approval Required

### Security Reviewers:

#### From CODEOWNERS:
- @security-squad

#### Extra Security Friends:
- @security-buddy

> ⚡ Need some security folks to take a peek!

### ℹ️ Note
Hi friends! Would love your eyes on this when you have a sec
